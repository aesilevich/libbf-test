# Testing libbf with Boost.Multiprecision Test Suite

## Background

The libbf library is an arbitrary-precision floating-point arithmetic library that is used as a part of the QuickJS virtual machine.

The objective of this project is to ensure the correctness and stability of the libbf library by performing additional testing beyond the existing libbf test suite.


## Approach

To ensure the stability and correctness of the libbf library, we decided to perform additional testing using the test suite from the boost.multiprecision library, which is a comprehensive set of tests designed for a generic implementation of integer and floating-point numbers.

To achieve this, we have implemented a boost.multiprecision backend on top of the libbf library for both integer and floating-point numbers. This allows us to run tests from the boost.multiprecision test suite to validate the correctness of the libbf library.


## Results

After running the boost.multiprecision test suite with the libbf backend, we found that the library works correctly for a wide range of inputs and scenarios. All the tests passed without any issues, and we did not encounter any errors or failures. This indicates that the libbf library is stable and reliable, and can be used in real-world applications with confidence.


## Structure of this project

The project has the following structure:
- `bf_float` - implementation of boost.multiprecision backends for floating-point and integer numbers on top of the the libbf library
- `test` - copy of all applicable boost.multiprecision tests with added support of libbf backed
- `quickjs` - quickjs git submodule containing libbf library
- `boost` - modular boost git submodule


## Building and running tests

To build and run the tests, follow these steps:
1. Pull all required submodules:
   ```
   cd <source_dir>
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. Configure the project using CMake:
   ```
   cd <build_dir>
   cmake <source_dir> [additional cmake options]
   ```
   You can specify additional cmake options when configuring the project, for example:
   - `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=...` and `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=...` - to set C and C++ compilers to build.
   - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug|Release]` - to set debug or release build type
3. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```
4. Run tests:
   ```
   ctest
   ```
